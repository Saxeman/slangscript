My first attempt at building a programming language from scratch. Built in C++ and using standard Object Oriented Programing format. The basis of this language is that each file is a party, as such there are various people invited, drinks and snacks that need to be bought, music, and other party related items to attend to.
Throughout the development of this language, various methods and functionality will be implemented using this scheme, and will be documented here.

Released:
 - This github page :/
 
Currently in Development:
 - Everything
 - Building a lexer to tokenize basic syntax such as comments, integers, addition, and subtraction

Future Plans:
 - Custom Class development
 - more robust functionality (ie; more variable types, more operations, maybe even pointer for direct memory management)
